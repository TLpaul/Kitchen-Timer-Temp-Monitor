🕒 Kitchen Timer and Temperature Monitor App
This is a simple Python-based kitchen timer and temperature monitoring app with a GUI built using tkinter. The app includes a timer for cooking and a simulated temperature sensor, which monitors and provides alerts when the temperature becomes too high. It uses system notifications for alerts and allows users to set a custom cooking time.

🚀 Features
Kitchen Timer: Set a custom timer for cooking and receive a notification when your food is ready.
Simulated Temperature Monitoring: Continuously monitors and simulates the kitchen temperature, sending a warning if the temperature exceeds a specified threshold (90°F).
Real-Time Updates: The GUI provides real-time feedback for the remaining time and the current temperature.
Cross-Platform Notifications: Uses plyer to send notifications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
📋 Requirements
Python 3.x
tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
plyer (pip install plyer)
💻 How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitchen-timer-app.git
cd kitchen-timer-app
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install plyer
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python kitchen_timer_app.py
Set Timer: Enter the desired cooking time in minutes and press the "Start" button.

Monitor Temperature: The app will display the current simulated temperature and notify you if it gets too high.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Add actual hardware sensor integration for real-time temperature data.
Enhance the UI for better user experience.
Allow users to customize temperature thresholds for alerts.
Add options for stopping or pausing the timer.
⚠️ Disclaimer
This app currently simulates temperature readings for demonstration purposes. For real-world kitchen use, an external sensor would be required to provide accurate temperature data.
